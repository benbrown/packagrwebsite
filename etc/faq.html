	  <h1>WHY?</h1>

<p>Digital publishing has changed, while our tools have remained static for nearly a decade. Publishers must look beyond the web towards the world of opportunity represented by&nbsp;connected devices, apps, stores, and subscriptions.</p>

<h1>WHAT?</h1>

<p>
Packagr is a new type of content creation tool. Our goal is to enable the creation of high quality, multi-media story telling experiences in a way that enables these stories to be published in many different formats, to many different devices in truly native packages.
</p>

<h1>WHO?</h1>

<p>Packagr is for people who work hands-on to create digital content. Designers, writers, strategists, editors and curators can use our tool to create cutting edge products.</p>

<h1>HOW?</h1>

<p>
	Packagr is different than traditional web content tools like Wordpress and Drupal in a few key ways:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Packagr works along side your existing tools. If you have a CMS that works, Packagr can automatically import your existing content, giving you new ways to use it.</li>
<li>The pages you create in Packagr are stored in a format agnostic way - allowing them to remain responsive, and to retain the intent of the designer when translated into a variety of final formats with different constraints.</li>
<li>Packagr is not another tool for making web sites. It contains powerful curation and packaging tools that can be used to create many different final products (including web sites).</li>
</ol>
