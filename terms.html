Payments will be charged to your Account on the date on which the relevant Service is first made available to you ("Activation Date"). Thereafter, each month following your Activation Date, on the day of such month representation the day of the month of your Activation Date (each such period, a "Subscription Period"), your subscription will automatically renew and your Account will be charged for the then-current monthly subscription fee, unless you cancel your subscription to the relevant Service prior to the first day of any new Subscription Period. Except as expressly stated by Packagr in these Terms, all fees paid or owed by you are non-refundable.</p>

Packagr reserves the right to change its fees and billing methods at any time; any changes to the fees or billing methods will be posted on the Site or through the Services. Your continued use of the Services after the changes have taken effect means that you accept such changes. You are responsible for paying any taxes that may apply, or relate to, your use of the Services (including, without limitation, any income or other taxes payable by you if you sell Publishing Materials developed using the Services), in addition to the fees or other applicable charges due under these Terms.</p>

<p>You agree that fees hereunder are based in part on the limitation of warranty, limitation of liability and remedies set forth in these Terms.</p>

<p>Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, special, consequential, or other damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. In such event, the liability of Packagr, its parent, affiliates, and subsidiaries, and its and their officers, directors, employees, contractors, licensors, licensees, third party service providers, and agents, for such damages with respect to the Site and Services will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law in such jurisdiction.</p>

<h3>20. Indemnification</h3>

<p>You hereby agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Packagr, its parent, affiliates, and subsidiaries, and its and their officers, directors, employees, contractors, licensors, licensees, third party service providers, and agents (each an "Indemnified Party") from and against any and all claims, actions, proceedings, demands, losses, costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees of attorneys and experts and costs of defense) incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with any actual or alleged claim arising out of or related to: (i) your use or misuse of the Site, Services, Software or Content, or the use or misuse of the Site, Services, Software or Content by any person using your Account, user name or persona; (ii) any breach by you of these Terms or any other terms applicable to your use of the Site, Services, Software or Content in any manner; (iii) any actual or alleged violation or non-compliance by you with any applicable local, state, federal or international law, rule or regulation, including, without limitation, the infringement, misappropriation or violation of the intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights, privacy rights, publicity rights, or any other rights of a third party; (iv) any interactions or dealings by you with other users of the Site and Services or any other third party in connection with your use of the Site and/or Services (including, without limitation, Apple and other web site and product providers); (v) any damage caused or alleged to have been caused by you to the Site, Service, Software or Content; and (vi) any use of the Submissions, Feedback or other materials you provide to Packagr in connection with your use of the Site and Services, or any Submissions or Feedback provided by any person using your Account, user name or persona.
Counsel you select for defense or settlement of a claim must be reasonably acceptable to Packagr and/or the other affected Indemnified Party(s) before such counsel can be engaged to represent you and Packagr and/or the other Indemnified Party(s). You and your counsel will cooperate as fully as reasonably required, and provide such information as reasonably requested, by the relevant Packagr and/or the other Indemnified Party(s) in the defense or settlement of any claim. Packagr and/or the other Indemnified Party(s) reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense or settlement, and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you. You agree that you will not, in any event, consent to any judgment, settlement, attachment, or lien, or any other act adverse to the interest of Packagr or any other Indemnified Party(s) without the prior written consent of Packagr and/or the other affected Indemnified Party(s).</p>

<p>By using the Services and Site, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Packagr, its parent, affiliates, and subsidiaries, and its and their officers, directors, employees, contractors, licensors, licensees, third party service providers, and agents with respect to any claims arising out of any action taken by Packagr as part of its investigation of a suspected violation of these Terms or as a result of its finding or decision that a violation of these Terms has occurred. This means that you cannot sue or recover any damages from Packagr, its parent, affiliates, and subsidiaries, and its and their officers, directors, employees, contractors, licensors, licensees, third party service providers, and agents as a result of its decision to remove or refuse to process any information or content, to warn you, to suspend or terminate your access to the Services or Site, or to take any other action during the investigation of a suspected violation or as a result of Packagr's conclusion that a violation of these Terms has occurred. This waiver and indemnity provision applies to all violations described in or contemplated by these Terms.</p>

<h3>21. General Terms</h3>

<p><b>Governing Law.</b><br/> The laws of the State of Texas, or where applicable the federal laws of the U.S.A., excluding conflicts of law rules, govern these Terms. Your use of the Services and Site may also be subject to other laws. Unless otherwise elected by Packagr in writing for a particular instance (which Packagr may do at its sole option), the state and federal courts seated in Austin, Texas, will have exclusive jurisdiction in respect of any and all matters relating to these Terms, including, without limitation, any claim arising from, or relating to, your use of the Site, Services, Software, Content, and your provision of Submissions and Feedback, and any claim involving Packagr, its parent, affiliates, and subsidiaries, and its and their officers, directors, employees, contractors, licensors, licensees, third party service providers, or agents, and you hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of such courts. You acknowledge that any actual or threatened breach of these Terms by you may result in immediate, irreparable harm to Packagr for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy, and that injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy for such breach or threatened breach, and notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, Packagr may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to these Terms or to any activities carried out by either party pursuant to these Terms. Furthermore, these Terms (including, without limitation, the use of the Site, Services, Software and Content) will not be governed or interpreted in any way by referring to any law based on the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) or any other act derived from or related to UCITA.
Jury Trial Waiver. TO THE EXTENT NOT OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY AGREE TO WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTERS ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS. Any claim or cause of action arising under, or relating to, these Terms must be commenced by you within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises.</p>

<p><b>Local Laws; Export Control.</b><br/> Packagr controls and operates the Site from its headquarters in the United States of America and the Site, Services, Software, Content, Submissions and Feedback may not be appropriate or available for use in other locations. If you choose to access the Site or use the Services from outside the United States of America, you do so on your own initiative, and you are solely responsible for complying with all local, state, federal, and national laws, statutes, ordinances, and regulations that apply to your use of the Site and Services. Any offer for any services made on the Site or through the Services is void where prohibited. You agree to comply with all export and re-export restrictions and regulations of the U.S. Department of Commerce and any other U.S. or foreign agencies and authorities in connection with your use of the Site and Services and to not transfer, or authorize the transfer, of any Software to a prohibited country or otherwise, in violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations. In particular, but without limitation, the Software may not, in violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations be exported or re-exported: (i) into any U.S. embargoed countries; or (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders.</p>

<p><b>U.S. Government Customers.</b><br/> Any Software provided by Packagr through the Site or Services is a "Commercial Item" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. Sec. 2.101, consisting of "Commercial Computer Software" (as defined in 48 C.F.R. Sec. 2.101) and "Commercial Computer Software Documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. Sec. 12.212 or 48 C.F.R. Sec. 227.7202, as applicable. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. Sec. 12.211 and 12.212, and 48 C.F.R. Sec. 227.7202-1 through Sec. 227.7202-4, as applicable, Software is being provided to U.S. Government Customers: (i) only as a Commercial Item; and (ii) with only those license rights as are granted to all other users pursuant to the terms and conditions of these Terms. This U.S. Government Customers clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFARS, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software or computer software documentation.</p>

<p><b>Assignment.</b><br/> Packagr may freely assign these Terms or any of its rights or obligations hereunder to any third party. Neither these Terms nor any obligations or rights hereunder may be assigned, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Packagr's prior written consent, which consent may be withheld in Packagr's sole discretion. Any attempted assignment in violation of this provision will be void. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will inure to the benefit of the parties' permitted successors and assigns.
Third Party Beneficiaries. These Terms will not be interpreted or construed to confer any rights or remedies on any third parties, except that each Indemnified Party will be deemed to be a third party beneficiary for purposes of these Terms. Therefore, each Indemnified Party will be entitled to directly enforce and rely upon any provision(s) of these Terms that confers a right or remedy in favor of such Indemnified Party.
Severability. If any part of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion will be interpreted in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intention of these Terms, and the remaining portions of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>

<p><b>Waiver.</b><br/> Any waiver by Packagr of any right or provision of these Terms must in a writing signed by Packagr. The failure of Packagr to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. These Terms will be interpreted without application of any strict construction in favor of or against you or Packagr.</p>

<p><b>Independent Contractors.</b><br/> Packagr and you are independent contractors, and nothing in these Terms is intended to create, or will be construed as creating, any employment, partnership, joint venture or comparable relationship.</p>
	
<p><b>Force Majeure.</b><br/> Packagr will have no liability to you or any third party for any failure by Packagr to perform its obligations under these Terms in the event that such non-performance arises as a result of the occurrence of an event beyond the reasonable control of Packagr, including without limitation an act of war or terrorism, natural disaster, failure of electricity supply, failure or delay in transportation, civil commotion or other event of force majeure.</p>

<p><b>Entire Agreement.</b><br/> These Terms, any additional terms and conditions posted on the Site, and the Privacy Policy, together constitute the entire agreement between you and Packagr with respect to the Site, Services, Software and Content (excluding any Services or Software that Packagr may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and supersede, cancel and replace any and all other oral or written negotiations, discussions or agreements between you and Packagr in respect of the Site, Services, Software and Content. No Packagr employee or agent has the authority to vary these Terms. Packagr may notify you with respect to the Services and Site by sending an email message to your Account email address or a letter via postal mail to your Account mailing address, or by a posting on the Services or Site. Notices will become effective immediately.</p>
